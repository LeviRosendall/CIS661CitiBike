This should work after the for loop code in MeanCont.Rmd

```{r}

library(viridis)
#install.packages("hrbrthemes")
library(hrbrthemes)

totalContamination <- unlist(totalContamination)
cleanedContamination <- unlist(cleanedContamination)
diff <- data.frame(station_name = Station_names, no_cleaning = totalContamination, with_cleaning = cleanedContamination)

diff2 <- diff %>% 
  pivot_longer(!station_name, names_to = "Cleaning_Status", values_to = "Contaminated_Bikes") %>% 
  mutate(Cleaning_Status = case_when( Cleaning_Status == "no_cleaning" ~ "Not Cleaned", TRUE ~ "Cleaned"))

png("cleaning.png")
head(diff2) %>%
  arrange(desc(Contaminated_Bikes)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(fill = Cleaning_Status, y = Contaminated_Bikes, x = station_name))+
  geom_bar(position="stack", stat="identity", width = .66)+
  scale_fill_viridis(discrete = T, option = "turbo") +
  theme_bw()+
  labs(title = "Contaminated Bikes Per Station\n in Cleaned vs. Not Cleaned State", x = "Station Name", y = "Contamined Bikes", fill = "Cleaning Status")+
  coord_flip()
dev.off()

```
